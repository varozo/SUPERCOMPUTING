Task 3. Write a 500-1000 word essay describing:
your motivation for learning high-performance computing
your goals for the course
your plan of attack for learning this semester
why the folder structure you created is good for reproducible research
your understanding of why we use documented code to do computational research tasks
anything else you want me to know about you, your background, or what/why you hope to learn 

My motivation for learning high-performance computing is to better handle my research at William & Mary's geoLab with Dr. Runfola. We were recently given a debrief on the kubernetes cluster and I am a bit familiar with how to schedule jobs for a given machine in the HPC (although I don't know the specifics nor mastered the terminology). In our lab, we are dealing with many spatial data points representing a grid, we are entering the stage of high-performance computing in order to accomplish our team's goals the best (and really only) way. My goals for the course are to refamiliarize myself with Git after taking Principles of Programming Languages where I began to learn the Shell. I also wish to be confident in my ability to create reproducible projects since after this Summer working with the DNREC to create reproducable spatial maps to place community solar hubs accross Delaware, starting with a small city. In terms of planning out my approach for learning the content of the course this semester, I plan on dedicating the weekends to the readings and starting the assignments, and throughout the week reviewing what we learn in class and practicing at home.

The structure I created in Assignment 1 is good for reproducible reasearch because I included a README in the file structure which contains all of the documentation of the code I used with Git and the Shell to create this file structure.

Although, I didn't include metadata yet because this assignment is just regarding the format of the file structure for this project, metadata is one of the more important things to include in your submitted code because it "includes details like software versions, when data was downloaded, and what version it is" (Page 7).

My understanding of why we use documented code to do computational research tasks is so that we can rerun all steps especially the key ones of an analysis if need be.

Lastly, I just want you to know I'm super excited to learn how this all works, especially since I understand there are special password permissions protecting our college's HPCs. I hope to learn specifically the intersection with biology since I understand that was the original purpose of the class and expand the kind of data I'm familiar with working with especially as it increases in scale.
